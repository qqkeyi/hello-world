# hello-world
keyi's first repo
Hi all!

The #hello world just asked me to white something about myself. So this is what I do.
Actually, I need to communicate with engineers everyday. I don't want to ask silly questions so I decide to equip myself with some knowledge of coding or programming. I think it'll be fun and will benefits a lot.
